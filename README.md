# CP/NET & MP/M Client-Server simulation

This is Following my research documented in my video
on [MP/M & CP/NET Networking Uncovered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI2rXPHUQ9c).

I wanted to get into CP/NET and MP/M networking,
and before tampering around with the real hardware,
get my stuff up and running using Udo Munk's [z80pack](https://github.com/udo-munk/z80pack) simulator.

What I wanted to achive, is a client-server simulation,
with one MP/M server, and four CP/NET clients as depicted here:

Building this was not as straight forward with `z80pack` and `cpmsim`,
as it needs some alterations, furtherly explained below.

But let's start first with what's contained in this repository:

- 1 set of MP/M 2.0 boot disks
 - sourced from [z80pack](https://www.icl1900.co.uk/unix4fun/z80pack/#download)
 - was recompiled using SYSGEN to have only 1 (instead of 3) TMPs
 - includes a patched and recompiled NETWRKIF.RSP to support 4 network connections
- 4 sets of CP/M 2.2 + CP/NET 1.2 boot disks
 - sourced from [z80pack](https://www.icl1900.co.uk/unix4fun/z80pack/#download)
 - includes a patched and recompiled SNIOS.RSP with a Unique Network Requestor ID per each disk
- The [cpnet](./cpnet) startup script, to run the simulation


# Prerequisites

You need:

- [z80pack](https://github.com/udo-munk/z80pack)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

Plus, of course, this repository.
Place all the files directly into your Â´./z80pack/cpmsim` directory, i.e. something like this:

```
cd ./z80pack/cpmsim
https://github.com/gpdm/TPC-CPNET-simulation/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
bsdtar xfv main.zip --strip-components=1
rm main.zip
chmod 755 ./cpnet
```

Note: You may not have the `bsdtar` available. So when extracting, make sure to strip away
the `TPC-CPNET-simulation` directory.

All files should be inside the `/z80pack/cpmsim` directory.

# Run it!

It's as simple as this, run the command from the `/z80pack/cpmsim` directory:

`./cpnet`

This will give you something like this:

And eventually you'll end up here:

# How it works

The simulation runs 1 server and 4 clients in the background.
They're launched into a `tmux` session, so you can switch through the consoles
using the usual `tmux` hotkeys, i.e.

- ^B-N (next)
- ^B-P (previous)
- `B+(0-4) for the indivual consoles

To exit from the simulation, simply type `bye` into each console window,
then press `^-C` to exit.

Note: If you don't press `^-C` the simulation on that console will restart.


# Behind the Scenes

The simulation rewrites the config files within the `./z80pack/cpmsim/conf` directory,
notably:

- `net_client.conf`
- `net_server.conf`

It does this to enable the MP/M server to run 4 listening serial consoles via a TCP socket,
and each client to allow for connecting to one of these TCP sockets for a simulated
serial connection.


# Applied Patches

The original MP/M images provided by Udo Munk were changed to allow 4 ingress serial line connections.
For that, the `NETWRKIF.ASM` file was patched to refer to the serial interfaces
0000h, 0100h, 0200h and 0300h in the source code.

Furtherly, `SYSGEN` was used to recompile the kernel, effectively reducing the TMPs (Terminal Message Processors)
from original 3 down to 1.

References will be provided in the [MPM patches](patches/mpm) directories.


As for the 4 CP/M + CP/NET disk images, these include changes in the `SNIOS.ASM` file,
essentially changing the network requestor ID to a unique value.

Without that, all simulations would run with the default ID of 11h, which would break
functions like CP/NET mail, which rely on having unique requestor IDs.
